\# HRIS — Integrity Hashes (SHA-256)



\*\*Purpose:\*\* This file records SHA-256 hashes for canonical HRIS documents.  

\*\*Rule:\*\* Append-only. Do not delete prior entries. If a canonical document changes, create a new versioned filename and add a new hash entry.



\*\*Important:\*\* README.md is intentionally NOT hashed here so the repo’s landing page can be refined without invalidating canonical document hashes.
